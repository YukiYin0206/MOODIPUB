It also arises when your needs are met. Thus, the feeling of joy helps you to know what's important to you and makes you seek more of it. For instance when you feel joy at the sight of someone you like, the emotion of joy lets you know how good it is to be with that person and that he or she means a lot to you.&#10&#10Joy also serves an important social function. Expressing joy makes those around you know that you appreciate them. When you share joy with other people, the feeling might increase in intensity and you feel more connected with those around you. Conversely, expressing joy to others , but not have it reciprocated, can be quite painful. Many who have grown up in homes where expressions of joy are inhibited might feel shameful of their own joy.&#10&#10Joy often feels like a lightness in your body, like you're a little warm, getting more energy and maybe bubbling a bit on the inside. It is also common to express tears of joy. This often happens when you experience a big relief, for instance in the aftermath of something difficult or scary.</textarea>

It is a cry out for what is lost and a wish to hold on to something that is important. A typical example is sadness or sorrow after losing someone you love, such as a family member, partner, or friend. But you can also be saddened by losing objects, access to places from where you have good memories, a job, opportunities, hopes or dreams.&#10&#10Sadness can be felt in many ways, but it is quite common to feel a knot in your stumoch, a lump in your throat, warmth in your face or simply a heavyness in your body. Being sad can be very painful and overwhelming, but it can in a strange way feel quite good. That is why we sometimes seek out sad movies or dwell in our sadness. It is common to cry when you are sad, and crying can at times feel quite soothing and calming.&#10&#10When you are sad and unable to regain what you have lost, your need is one of comfort, support, and care from others. Sometimes we have the need to pull back an be by ourselves. However, if you are always alone with your sadness there is a danger of the sadness turning into a more depressed state.</textarea>

Fear overrides almost all other emotions and makes you do anything to get away from whatever is threatening you.&#10&#10It is one of the very oldest emotions we have, and has been critical to ensuring survival, simply because it has helped us avoid and get away from predators and threats. In modern days fear usually deals people who are unpredictable and might hurt you, situations that feel impossible to deal with, illnesses or potential accidents.&#10&#10The bodily sensation of fear is often increased heart beat, rapid breathing, cold hands and feet, and dryness in the mouth. It can also feel like excessive energy in your body. High activation of fear can also be experienced as dizziness, tunnel vision or even nausea. In milder forms, fear can be experienced as unrestfullness or being alert.&#10&#10When you feel fear, the affected need is safety, protection, and feeling like you can master your environment. Mastering fear is a very rewarding experience, which might explain why so many people enjoy extreme sporting or scary movies. If the fear seems impossible to deal with or you cannot get away, it is not uncommon to either become aggressive and attack or to give up and submit.</textarea>

In other words, anger often arises when someone treats you or your loved ones poorly, someone invades your personal boundaries or when someone prevent you from achieving something that is important to you. Anger is what gives you the strength and power to protect and stand up for yourself, for others, and for your values and needs.&#10&#10In its purest form, anger is perceived as a helpful force and energy. It is common to experience it as energy in your hands and feet, warmth in your chest, and in a stronger form you may want to push away or hit. In milder forms, it feels like confidence, determination, or simply feeling strong and clear. The overall need in anger is to set boundaries, create distance and to protect that which is important to you. We often call primary helpful anger for assertive anger. Such anger can be quite healthy. Experiencing and expressing healthy anger at someone who has scared you or shamed you might give you a sense of dignity and protection, but only if it's primary anger that you are in control over.</textarea>

Disgust has served a primitive function to help us stay away from food, plants and waste that is poisonous or in other ways not good for us. In a more advanced social form, disgust and it's cousin contempt helps us to signal to others that they have violated the groups basic needs and values. Disgust and contempt in society can arise against groups or individuals that are believed to violate important norms. Disgust and contempt in smaller groups, as within a couple, often occur if the partner ceases to pay attention to common values and standards.&#10&#10Disgust is often experienced as wanting to get rid of something or someone. The facial expression looks as if the person is experiencing a foul smell. In its most intense form, the experience of disgust is nausea, and in a milder sense it is an experience of wanting to turn away and show displeasure.&#10&#10The most basic need in disgust and contempt is to protect oneself from illness and things that are dangerous to oneself or the herd. In a more advanced sense, the need is to protect oneself from something that threatens one's values, or against anything that threatens the group.</textarea>

Guilt is meant to motivate you to repair the damage you've caused to an important relationship. It is closely related to the feeling of shame, but is not necessarily related to the feeling of who you are.&#10&#10Contrary to shame, guilt does not make you want to hide or disappear, but rather to approach the other to repair, show regret, apologize or help the other. Guilt is rather about preserving or restoring the relationship to the other. If you are going to apologize to someone you have hurt, it is therefore important that you actually show genuine remorse, without taking too many reservations or giving rationalizations. This makes it more likely that the other can forgive you.&#10&#10Where guilt is the feeling of having done something wrong, shame is more the feeling of being wrong. So it's not just about something you've done, but about who you are as a person, and you feel you're not good enough, or worth less than others. You can feel shame related to your appearance, your abilities or your personality traits.&#10&#10In many ways, shame is about being a part of a community and about being accepted by your group or your peers. You feel shame when your place in the group is somehow threatened, whether the group is the society at large, your family, your group of friends, your couples relationship or your work place. Shame arises when you have been humiliated, or when something threatens your belonging to the group.&#10&#10Shame is often experienced as wanting to not be seen by the others. Others' gaze may feel like its burning. You blush and you want to sink into the ground and disappear. Shame is often reported as discomfort or even pain in the stumoch.</textarea>

However, jealousy is often a problematic feeling. Many of those who struggle with recurring jealousy probably is struggling with problematic shame, fear, and sadness.
